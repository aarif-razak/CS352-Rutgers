1. Briefly discuss how you implemented your recursive client functionality.
The client first establishes a connection with the rs server, then reads in
from the input file line by line. For each line, if it is requesting an 'A'
record, then the client will query from the rs server. If the rs server
responds with a name server, then the client will request from that server.
The responses are written to the output file after each line.

2. Are there known issues or functions that aren't working currently in your
   attached code? If so, explain.
As far as we can tell there are no issues.

3. What problems did you face developing code for this project?
We first wrote the programs as if they would all be running on the same machine,
i.e. a client/servers from localhost. One problem we came across was how to get
the programs to work on separate machines. Another thing we had to figure out was
how to store and format the information given in the input file. We chose to use
a 3-tuple to match the format of the input, e.g ('mx.rutgers.edu', '192.64.4.2', 'A').

4. Reflect on what you learned by working on this project.
We learned the basics of python networking which will definitely help us in future
projects. We also learned some basic python I/O functions as well as how tuples
work in python.
