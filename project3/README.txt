1. Functionality was implemented utalizing the 'ip addr help' and 'ip route help' commands to understand the structure of a request. Majority of the project was done for us in terms of making the hosts and the router setup. To implement the interfaces we used 'ip addr add' to assign the proper IP addresses as needed. The default routes were achived using the 'ip route add default' command to enforce a default interface. The pre destination routes were also assigned using the 'ip route' command with some trial and error.

2. As of now, no issues in the code.

3. Sometimes the linux terminal wouldn't accept commands that were clearly correct, and alot of syntax errors due to this being done in powershell. Otherwise, no issues.

4. We learned alot about how to manually add and route traffic along hosts. Additionally, mininet seems really intuative in teaching and running your own IP server, curious to see how to implment things like subnets within such a program.
